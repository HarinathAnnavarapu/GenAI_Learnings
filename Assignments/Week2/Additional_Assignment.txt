Participants:

Anita (Product Manager - Organizer)
Ravi (Business Analyst)
Meera (UX Designer)
Suresh (QA Lead)
Hari (Engineering Lead)

Anita (PM):
“Good afternoon, team. Today’s goal is to finalize the roadmap for the next two quarters and identify owners for the critical features. Let’s start with business priorities. Ravi, can you brief us?”

Ravi (BA):
“Sure, Anita. Based on customer feedback, three major priorities are:

Simplified onboarding — customers want fewer fields.

Payments integration — specifically UPI and net banking.

Enterprise dashboard customization.
These two, onboarding and payments, will need engineering evaluation. Hari, that’ll fall under your review.”

Anita (PM):
“Noted. Meera, what do you see from the UX side?”

Meera (UX Designer):
“Users drop off during signup because of the long forms. I recommend we add auto-fill via CKYC/Aadhaar APIs. That would drastically improve the onboarding experience. Hari will need to confirm if that’s feasible.”

Anita (PM):
“Good point. Suresh, what about QA readiness?”

Suresh (QA Lead):
“From QA’s perspective, payments are always sensitive. We’ll need mock APIs for UPI/net banking early so regression testing can begin without waiting for live integration. Hari, you’ll need to provide those mocks.”

Anita (PM):
“Thanks, everyone. To summarize:

Onboarding auto-fill (via CKYC/Aadhaar).

Payment integration (UPI + net banking).

Enterprise dashboards.

Hari, your key action items are:

Do a feasibility study for UPI & net banking integration.

Explore CKYC/Aadhaar API POC for onboarding auto-fill.

Share mock APIs with QA for payments testing.

Hari, could you please confirm you’ve noted these?”

Hari (Engg Lead):
“Yes, Anita. I’ve captured all three actionables: feasibility study for payments, POC for onboarding auto-fill, and mock APIs for QA. I’ll prepare updates for the next sync.”

Anita (PM):
“Perfect. Thanks, everyone. Let’s close the meeting here.”
